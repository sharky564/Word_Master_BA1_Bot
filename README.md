# Word_Master_BA1_Bot
Bot that plays the Word Master minigame on Bookworm Adventures Volume 1. Plays deterministically, maximising entropy for guesses, and saving to memory once found.

To play, launch Bookworm Adventures 1, and get onto the screen for Word Master. Run main.py and go back to the game screen. The bot will launch and locate the game, 
and begin by reading through every tile to determine what each tile looks like (it uses a single pixel to identify each pixel). Afterwards, it will start playing 
properly and you can leave it for however long you want.
